## Your SMART Home Security System!

### Brief:
Security is the main concern of every person, be it someone living in an apartment complex or someone living in their own house. 
Nowadays, people go out to work early in the morning and come home late at night, and the house is left unguarded for a long time. 
This increases the probability of thefts and breach of security.<p></p>
Therefore, we have come up with the idea of SECURIFY, a “smart” home security system, which will use electronic keypad-based smart locking system instead of traditional mechanical locks for homes which can be opened only with a correct password. Unauthorised access or entering the wrong password will trigger an alert message in the owner’s mobile phone thus making him aware that someone else is trying to enter his/her home without permission. 

Along with this, there will be a real time face recognition system, wherein, the owner will receive alerts when someone is at his/her door. The face recognition system will identify known people and notify the owner accordingly.

### Instructions to Use the Code:
#### 1. For the keypad operated door lock system using Arduino & IoT

#### 2. For the Real time facial recognition system using Computer Vision.
Step 1: Install the OpenCV package on your local system. (open command prompt and type pip install opencv-python)

Step 2: Open collectData.py on your local IDE. Create a folder in the same directory as that of your file and name it as "data". Now execute the code.

Step 3: A window capturing video from your webcam will open. Look into the webcam and make sure that your face is being detected. (a blue rectangle will be formed around your face)

Step 4: After a few seconds, press 'q' to close the window. Your facial data has been stored in the data folder.

Step 5: Next, install the packages Numpy and Pillow on your system. (pip install numpy, pip install pillow).

Step 6: Now open and run classifier.py on your IDE. A new "classifier.yml" file will be created in the same directory.
